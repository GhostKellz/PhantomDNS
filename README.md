> A blazing-fast, modern, Go-native DNS resolver and filter engine. Built for speed, simplicity, and control â€” no unbound or BIND required.

## âœ¨ Features

- Ad/tracker blocking with hostlist support
- DNS-over-TLS / DNS-over-HTTPS (planned)
- Authoritative DNS support (planned)
- Lightweight Web UI and YAML config
- Written entirely in Go (no system dependencies)

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

```bash
go run main.go
```

Listens on `:53` UDP by default (requires root or CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE).

## ðŸ§© Roadmap

- [x] UDP resolver w/ upstream fallback
- [ ] Config loader
- [ ] Cache layer (go-cache or ristretto)
- [ ] Blocking engine
- [ ] HTTP API + Web UI
- [ ] DoH / DoT support
- [ ] Auth DNS zone files
- [ ] Docker + systemd service
