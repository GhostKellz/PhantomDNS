> A blazing-fast, modern, Go-native DNS resolver and filter engine. Built for speed, simplicity, and control â€” no unbound or BIND required.
--- 
## âœ¨ Features

- Recursive DNS resolution (forwarding, caching)
- Ad/tracker blocking with hostlist support
- DNS-over-TLS / DNS-over-HTTPS (planned)
- Authoritative DNS support (planned)
- Lightweight Web UI and YAML config
- Written entirely in Go (no system dependencies)
- Optional Web UI served on port 5380 â€” designed for performance-conscious deployments.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Arch Linux (PKGBUILD)

1. Clone the repo and build the package:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ghostkellz/PhantomDNS.git
   cd PhantomDNS
   makepkg -si
   ```
2. Configuration, certs, and root hints will be installed to `/etc/pdns/`.
3. Systemd services and timers for PhantomDNS and daily root hints refresh will be installed and enabled.
4. On first install, `server.crt` and `server.key` will be generated if missing.

### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)

1. Clone the repo and build the .deb package:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ghostkellz/PhantomDNS.git
   cd PhantomDNS
   ./build-deb.sh
   sudo dpkg -i phantomdns_*.deb
   ```
2. Configuration, certs, and root hints will be installed to `/etc/pdns/`.
3. Systemd services and timers for PhantomDNS and daily root hints refresh will be installed and enabled.
4. On first install, `server.crt` and `server.key` will be generated if missing.

### Manual/Portable Install (Optional)

1. Run the provided `setup.sh` script:
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
2. This will build PhantomDNS, copy files to `/etc/pdns/`, generate certs/root hints if missing, and enable/start the systemd service/timer.

## ðŸ”„ Root Hints Auto-Refresh
- A script and systemd timer/cronjob will keep root hints up to date daily in `/etc/pdns/`.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
go run main.go
```

Listens on `:53` UDP by default (requires root or CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE).

## ðŸ§ª Commands 

```bash
phantom -r   # Restart and reload configuration
phantom -u   # Update blocklists from URLs
phantom -s   # Show DNS server status
phantom -c   # Clear in-memory DNS cache
```

## ðŸ§© Roadmap

- [x] UDP resolver w/ upstream fallback
- [ ] Config loader
- [ ] Cache layer (go-cache or ristretto)
- [ ] Blocking engine
- [ ] HTTP API + Web UI
- [ ] DoH / DoT support
- [ ] Auth DNS zone files
- [ ] Docker + systemd service
